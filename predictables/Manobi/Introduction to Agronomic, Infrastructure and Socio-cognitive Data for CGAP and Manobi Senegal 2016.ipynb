    "This is a sister notebook to Paul's that groups variables in the Manobi and CGAP data into questions about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agronomic: Land, yields, management\n",
    "- Infrastructure: Water, roads, challenges to trade, mobility\n",
    "- Social/cognitive: Beliefs, interests, decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I'll list the variables relevant to each group and add some code to make it easier to grab variables out of the Manobi dataset. We don't yet have a way to align Manobi and CGAP data in the same dataframes, so I've stuck to lists of Manobi variables for ease of indexing. For groups about finance, commerce and demographics, go to Paul's notebook. Also check out Paul's notebook for a useful review of how to access Manobi and CGAP data and get descriptions of the questions.\n",

    "Disclaimer: I'm using the 2016-2017 Manobi data for this notebook. There's more detailed agronomic data in later years, but these are being organized and cleaned by the Manobi crew. I'll update this notebook accordingly when all the data is in the same structure."

In 2016, Manobi collected information related to \"this\" or \"last\" season (\"season 1\") and \"the coming\" season (\"season 2\"). If you check out my notebook [here](https://pitt.box.com/s/d3m2251ktfwor76ruezorphzec8fr4ut) you can see which time periods these seasons actually fall in.
